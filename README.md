# Ultra-filtered Milk Permeate Community Metagenomics

This is repository for the paper "A Metagenome-level Analysis of a Microbial Community Fermenting Ultra-filtered Milk Permeate" (Walters et al., 2023). This repository contains Joint Genome Institute (JGI) sourced general feature format (GFF) files of the abundant metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from the ultra-filtered milk permeate fermenting microbial community described in the paper. These files were used in the metabolic network analysis. Nucleotide sequences for each MAG are also included at the bottom of the gff file.

## JGI gff files provided are for the following MAGs
- ACID1
- ACT2
- ATO3
- ATO6
- BIF2
- BIF11
- BIF18
- CLOS1
- LCO1
- SPH2
