# Ultra-filtered Milk Permeate Community Metagenomics

This is repository for the paper "A Metagenome-level Analysis of a Microbial Community Fermenting Ultra-filtered Milk Permeate" (Walters et al., 2023). This repository contains Joint Genome Institute (JGI) sourced general feature format (GFF) files of the abundant metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from the ultra-filtered milk permeate fermenting microbial community described in the paper. These files were used in the metabolic network analysis.
